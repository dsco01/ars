59.0.4:
* Should fix "TileHidden cannot be cast to TileEntityCodeDoor"

59.0.2:
* Fixed "NoSuchFieldError: defaultVolume" crash with updated IC2.

59.0.1:
* Refined iron ingots replaced with refined iron plates in all recipes. Fixes crash.

59.0.0:
* Updated to 1.7.10.

58.1.0:
* Official 1.7.2 update.
* Logic card recipes will consume their ingredients. (possibly temporary depending on whether it even makes a difference)
* Changed refined iron to normal iron in one recipe, since refined iron was removed.
* Items (MFDs, blank cards, link cards, logic tokens, crafting ingredients) will be deleted when upgrading from 1.6.4. Sorry!
* Fixed forcefields not getting any power with "preferredEnergySystem=infinite"
* Forcefields look bad or invisible at a distance because of 1.7's mipmapping (texture smoothing).
* New bug: Several GUIs have syncing problems.
* New bug: forcefields camouflaged with ice are not translucent.
* New bug: forcefields camouflaged with stained glass are just weird.

57.2.0:
* EMP upgrades, forcefield cores and tesla coils can use different power systems - set the preferredEnergySystem option in immibis.cfg.
* Removed the ability to right click with a frequency card to see a random number.

57.1.1:
* Fixed DeFence IDs not being added to config file.

57.1.0:
* Absorbed the old mod DeFence. As a result:
  * Added chain link fences.
  * Added barbed wire fences.
  * Added code doors, which are doors locked by a 4-digit PIN.
    Only breakable by the owner or in creative.
    This might change as it could be used for griefing.

57.0.0:
* Updated to Minecraft 1.6.4.
* Updated to experimental IC2.

56.0.0:
* Updated to Minecraft 1.6.2.
* Removed deprecated blocks: reactor containment field projector, EU injector, reactor connector.
* Fixed crash when double-clicking slots.

55.1.4:
* Fixed beam code not using isAirBlock to check for air.

55.1.3:
* Fixed empty 1 and 2 sections being created in config file.
* Industrial tesla coils use a whitelist of entities to attack, instead of a blacklist
  (This means they won't attack any unknown entities; mobs from other mods will still be attacked)
* Arrows and other projectiles can be destroyed by industrial tesla coils.
* Destroying a projectile always costs 500 EU instead of using as much EU as possible.
  It's also faster than attacking a player or mob.

55.1.2:
* Reobfuscated with SRG names; fixes AbstractMethodError.

55.1.1:
* Fixed forcefield filters not working with area projectors.

55.1.0:
* Item detection filters now target dropped items (which match the item in the filter) as well as players.
* Made everything relating to data beams glowy (like xycraft ore)
* Made forcefield projectors glowy (also like xycraft ore)
* Fixed being able to mine data beams with silk touch.
* Fixed a small texture bug with programmable filters.
* Added input mode icon to the programmable filter GUI.
* Added coloured input tokens.
* Fixed zapper+camo forcefields using the wrong texture when no block is in the camouflage upgrade.
* Directional Projector renamed to Line Projector (as intended).
* Added (DEPRECATED) tags to reactor field projectors, reactor connectors.
  Reactor field projectors are redundant - use an area projector with an offset.
* Added (DEPRECATED) tag to EU injector. If you somehow still have one, just supply power to the core directly.
* enableReactorBlocks defaults to false.
* Apologized for being like Sengir and removing things. This mod is not Nuclear Control. At least nothing was nerfed.

55.0.1:

52.0.6:
* Changed blank card recipe slightly, so it no longer conflicts with MFFS.
* Added reverse crafting recipes for projectors.

52.0.5:
* Removed some code that caused rare crashes when opening GUIs, and didn't seem to do anything useful.

52.0.4:
* Recompiled with Java 6.

52.0.3:
* Fixed packaging again.

52.0.2:
* Fixed mcmod.info

* Updated to 1.4.6.

51.0.3:
* Fixed cooldown when the world time is changed.

51.0.2:
* Fixed config sections and renamed many options. Existing configs should auto-convert.
  If anything is left over in the 0/1/2 sections, it's not used and you can delete it.
* Added max tesla range option (default 100)

51.0.1:
* Updated textures (by kaj_)
* Fixed an exploitable world-breaking server crash that could also be triggered accidentally.

* Fixed colour of forcefield filter beam.

51.0.0:
* Updated to 1.4.5.
* Ended support for 1.2.5, 1.3.2 and 1.4.2.

50.2.4:
* Removed debug message.
* Another potential fix for the reactor crash bug.

50.2.3:
* Compiled against updated IC2, may fix reactor crash bug (1.4.2 only)

50.2.2:
* Fixed top and bottom textures being swapped on some forcefield-related blocks.
* Found out why reactor monitor clients don't work - you need to set them up like this: http://puu.sh/1myiu

* Fixed invisible GUI text in 1.4.2.
* Fixed hotbar items being visible in directional extender GUI.

50.2.0:
* Updated to 1.4.2

50.1.1:
* Fixed a crash

50.1.0:
* Changed: RENAMED CONFIG FILE TO AdvancedRepulsionSystems.cfg TO AVOID CONFLICT WITH MFFS!
* Changed: Moved textures from /mffs_grafik to /immibis/ars/textures to avoid conflicts with
  MFFS. This will break existing texture packs!
* Changed: New forcefield machine textures by Ivysaur1996.
* Changed: New tesla machine textures by kaj_says. (Except the temporary ones)
* Changed: Almost all recipes.
* Changed: Built-in storage of a forcefield core decreased from 10M to 1M forcepower (100k EU).
* Changed: Default range of a forcefield core increased from 8 to 16 blocks.
* Changed: Blank card recipe now creates 8 cards.
* Changed: Right click will not open GUIs if you're sneaking, instead of if you're holding a lever or ARS block.
* Changed: In 1.3.2 the coolant injector will recharge RSH and LZH condensators using lapis and redstone from its inventory.
* Changed: Blank cards stack to 64.
* Removed: ID tool MFDevice from the code.
* Removed: reactor link MFDevice from the code.
* Removed: old (useless) ID cards from the code.
* Removed: oldNames option.
* Added: Industrial tesla coil and related blocks. Uses two more block IDs - one for the machines and one for the "lasers."
* Added: Speed, EMP, range, and suppressor upgrades for industrial tesla coils.
* Added: Upgrade multiplexers (for tesla coil upgrades)
* Added: Programmable filters, logic tokens, forcefield filters, and item detection filters (for tesla coil target filtering)
         Note: Some items besides logic tokens are acceptable in programmable filters.
* Added: Loot collector (tesla coil upgrade)
* Added: Remote potion applicator (tesla coil upgrade)
* Added: Config option to disable tesla coil etc (disables registration of those block IDs)
* Added: Config option to disable reactor-related blocks (disables recipes only)
* Added: Config option for extra storage from a storage upgrade.
* Added: Config option for default storage of a forcefield core.
* Added: Config option for default range of a forcefield core.
* Added: You can now right click on a core with a blank card to encode it.
* Added: You can now right click on a projector with a frequency card to insert it.
* Renamed: some items that had MFFS in their name
* Renamed: directional projector to "Line forcefield projector"
* Renamed: directional extender to "Line projector extender"
* Renamed: deflector to "Plate forcefield projector"
* Renamed: reactor heat control to "Reactor coolant injector"
* Fixed: Tube projectors now retain their X and Y offset between world loads.
* Fixed: Reactor coolers now use their "active" texture when they're active.
* Fixed: Machines not updating visually until a block near them changed.
* Re-added: Recipes for reactor blocks (if enabled)

50.0.2:
* Fixed camouflaged field blocks being broken in SMP. (requires Immibis Core update)

50.0.1:
* Fixed direction being invisible.
* Renamed to Advanced Repulsion Systems.

50.0.0pr1:
* Changed version numbering scheme
* Updated to 1.3.2
* Known problem: Direction is not visible on any blocks.
* Known problem: Reactor blocks are not updated to work with new reactors.
                 In particular the cooler may need balancing since it allows CASUCs.

rev10.2:
* Fixed console spam from directional extenders.
* Fixed being able to offset a directional extender independently from the main projector.

rev10.1:
* Fixed reactor containment projectors centering the field on the projector instead of the reactor.
* Fixed area projectors not accepting dome upgrades.
* Tube projectors now accept dome upgrades. Mostly useful on horizontal tubes.

rev10:
* Made forcefields instantly break boats that are stuck in them.
  With a zapper upgrade, they will also break boats that touch them.
* Internal changes to allow large forcefields to have inhibitor
  upgrades without lagging.
* Fixed vertical tube projectors in "front" mode?
* Added a cooldown to field activation and deactivation to prevent spam.
  It takes about 1 tick per 40 force field blocks. A cube with a radius
  of 16 will take about 8 seconds. Adjustable by cooldownBlocksPerTick in
  the config.
* Removed recipe for remote reactor link, since it didn't even do anything.
* Removed ID-tool mode of MFD, since it was useless. If you have one, you
  can still craft it back to wrench mode.
  Crafting a wrench-mode MFD now switches it to...
* Offset mode. Right click on any side of a projector to shift the entire
  field in that direction. Sneak to shift in opposite direction.
* Added recipe for the inhibitor upgrade (machine block + 4 carbon plates)
* Allowed wiring directly to cores.
* Disabled recipe for EU injector.
* Cores accept energy in complete packets, so no more increased cable losses.
* Cores will not use any EU's if that would waste energy (if there's <10 FP missing)
* Projectors now drop their contents when broken (but not reactor monitors
  and camouflage upgrades)
* Frequency cards (all types) can be crafted by themselves to reset them.

rev9:
* Added unfinished inhibitor upgrade. On large forcefields, may cause lag or slow forcefield generation. You shouldn't use this yet.
* Fixed players being able to crash the server with a ClassCastException.
* Removed a debug message

rev8:
* Registered force field block correctly for Bukkit.
* Required clients to have the mod if the server has it.

rev7:
* Added configurable limits to config file. maxProjectorSize controls most limits, except for tube radius and deflector distance.
* Made forcefield blocks render faces that are touching other types of force fields correctly
* Made block-breaker fields no longer break tile entities.
* Reduced lag from large tube forcefields (by only refreshing the actual forcefield blocks and not the ones in the middle)
* Added configurable refresh speed (in blocks/tick/projector) - when you have a block blocking
  a forcefield, this affects the time it takes for it to be replaced with a forcefield block. 

rev6:
* Refactored more code.
* Block cutter should now properly drop all blocks.
* Tube projectors can make holes in other force fields linked to the same generator again.
* slowGenerate removed. Forcefields generate instantly.

rev5:
* Refactored lots of projector-related code.
* Block-cutter, zapper and camouflage upgrades work on all projectors (except reactor fields)
* Dome upgrade works on tube projectors
* Camouflage upgrade works in SMP
* Changed area projector max height to 255 instead of 127
* Quadrupled area projector power consumption; previously the number
  of force field blocks was estimated incorrectly and accounted for only 1/4
  of the blocks.
* Halved area projector power consumption (stacks with above)
  if a dome upgrade is present, since there are only half the field blocks.
* Reactor field can now be placed 1 block away from a 0-chamber reactor.
* Outline of zapper forcefields fixed when pointing at them
* Zapper forcefield particles now spawn at a random location inside the block,
  instead of always at the centre.
* Fixed zapper forcefields not hurting things that jump upwards into them.
* Zapper forcefields now count as generic damage instead of void damage
  - so they can't hurt creative players any more
* Fixed typo causing zapper forcefields to have weird collision boxes.
* Made force field blocks not made by a projector decay, like leaves
  - in case you somehow get a field block without a projector
* Changed: Tube projectors no longer poke holes in other forcefields.
* Discoveries:
  - Reactor containment fields will turn on if the reactor exceeds 75% of its max heat
    (ignoring reactor plating) and will automatically get the block cutter upgrade
* Bugs:
  - Projectors sometimes don't visually face the right way when placed in SMP.
    reconnecting fixes this. so does changing a block next to the projector.
  - Zapper and camouflage upgrades do not work together
  - Some sides of field blocks touching the ground can be darkened. Most noticeable
    when using camouflage upgrades.
  - If a camouflage upgrade is destroyed, its contents are not dropped.
* Fixed upgrades not changing appearance when activated in SMP

rev4:
* Hopefully fixed load order problems (edit: actually didn't,
  but this wasn't the mod with the load order problems, that was Dimensional Anchors)

rev3:
* Fixed crash when opening deflector GUI
* Changed uninsulated to insulated copper cable in recipes
* Fixed large forcefields not working near bedrock level
* May have fixed forcefields not working sometimes in SMP if not placed near Z=0 and nobody was near Z=0 to load that chunk
* Changed TileEntityProjektor.field_queue from a LinkedList to a HashSet
  - results in forcefields being built in a different randomish order
    instead of bottom-to-top
* Added slowGenerate config option
  - If true, forcefields are generated at 400 blocks/second
  - If false, 400 blocks/tick = 8000 blocks/second
  - Defaults to true on servers, false on clients
